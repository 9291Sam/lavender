Story:



Gameplay:
Larged forced cutscene at the beginnig
Explore, fight, and try to decyper the strange world that you have found yourself
in


Common puzzles: Doors with magical keys (find on the body of one of the workers)

You were just a normal person, traveling between towns in your world

one day you were suddenly ambushed, you tried your hardest to fight back, but 
you were of no match for the bandits. They probablly just wanted your meager
treasure and would be on their way, you've been robbed before and this is 
probablly going to be okay, unfortunately this time one of them [Ensomber]'d you
the next thing you know you wake up in the back of a cariage, bound and unable 
to move, after that youre getting dragged into the foot of a mountain 
eventually you see it, a dragon. 

"Oh great [dragon name] we've come here to offer you this human sacrifice and
treasure, in exchange may you please improve our abilities (grants another spell)
"

they pitter patter away and then the dragon forms down and looks at you,
you, you're different, you're useful... 'oh, no matter' CUT TO BLACK

next is groggy intermissions over the course of the next few years, youre locked in some tank, drowning

after that 100s of years pass and you get ejectected from the tank, you have no memory (dont speak??)
and yorue just wtf happened?!

"who am I? what is going on here, I have to get out"

puzzle escape, at the same time you were released many other things that the dragon
had been keeping are also breaking free

escape? theres noone there (introduces you to the mechanics of the game) what are they?



Wake up: 

In the room is a single dead helper, with a gem key and a wand with a few charges
adventure forth and find more
different helpers with different things
