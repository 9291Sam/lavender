# The Sacrificed of Verdant

You had always heard of the stories of dragons swooping down and burning people,
you know that it *happened* but you never really thought it would happen to you.

Well, one day, one entirely normal and unremarkable day, while you were 
traveling between towns you get jumped. These looked to be normal bandits, they
probably just wanted some of your money and would gladly take some in exchange
for your life, but as you were preparing to surrender you see your vision start
to haze, and then the dreaded purple star like shapes come in, crap, you're
being put to sleep.

The next thing you know you're in the back of a carriage and are being moved
to [GOD_NAME]'s knows where. Eventually, after a shockingly short voyage, you 
see out of the back of the carriage that you're entering the base of a mountain.
At this your chest goes cold. There's only one mountain nearby and it's rumored 
to be the spot of the largest dragon hoard in the known world.

After a few minutes you're thrown out of the back of the carriage and the dragon
that was half in myth was suddenly right in front of you, frothing.

"Oh great [DRAGON_NAME] we've come with this offering of your greatness, in
exchange would you please improve our magical abilities"

'SHIT, they're exchanging me!' 

The dragon stops and stares for a few seconds before looking right at you and
a golden hazy beam emits from between it's eyeballs. You brace for impact,
however at the last moment it sails right over you and you presume it hit one
of your kidnappers.

After that you hear them excitedly scurry away, and the dragon looks at you,
alone. It speaks in your language with a hauntingly beautiful voice: "You're 
different, you're useful..., oh! no matter!" #CUT_TO_BLACK
