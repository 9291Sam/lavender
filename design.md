Things I find interesting:

voxels (many)

destructableopen world? wold it be easier to make a dungeoncrawler?

magic simulation (tabs?)


Brainstorming:


island hopper
open world (above ground, unconstrained)
dungeon crawler (underground, constrained)


Eventual goal: dnd style planes

current goal a fun game in one plane


Lore: 
The entire thing takes place on a megastructure with different Realms

one AI in the center

creates the illussion that its a magic world

what does this imply:



mvp game
escape the wyvern?
what if the mechanic is a fully fleshed out magic system

sneaky escape from a wyvern
you get to make up the lore!



silly goofy, yorue a person that was sacrificed to a dragon
