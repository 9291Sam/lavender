# Notable Features
- Isolated Render and Tick threads
- Pervasive use of fork-join parallelism
- Asynchronous chunk generation
- Dynamic & real time raycast shadows via compute shaders
- Custom entity management mechanism that's a combination of ECS and OOP principles
- Probably a lot more, feel free to ask me questions. Discord: `9291Sam`
